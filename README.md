# Indecision_API

This is the GitHub repository for this **Indecision_API** project I made using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) to learn the basics of this framework.

In this project you can make a question and show the result from this API --> [YesNo](https://yesno.wtf/).

Also I used [JEST](https://jestjs.io/es-ES/) to learn the basics of Vue Unit Testing.

It was simple but funny! :)

### Now it's deployed here https://indecision-tcp.netlify.app/
